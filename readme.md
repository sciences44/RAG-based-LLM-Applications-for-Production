## Purpose

- Develop a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) from scratch
- Make an application scalable (load, chunk, index, serve...)
- Evaluate different configurations of the app to optimize percomponent (ex: retrieval score) and overall performance (quality score)
- Implement a hybrid agent routing approach b/w OSS and closed LLMs to create the most performant and cost effective application.
- Servce application in high availability
- Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, lexical search, reranking, data flywheel, etc.

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to use LLM in a custom manner. LLM have been trained on a large amount of data. However must of the case, when we want to adapt them to a corporation, to our own documentations or even to recent informations published on the web, we are limited.

This is where the RAG (retrieval augmented generation) comes into play ðŸª„

RAG allows LLM to be updated with new infotmations without being retrained.

## Prerequisite and installations 

As we are going to use Ray, you will need to have the app ðŸ™‚. Normally it should be deployed in the cloud but I guess that a lot of you want to try it in local to avoid expensive cost. On my side, I used helm to deploy it on my mac m1. You will have the instruction on the makefile for those who have the same config. Otherwise please have a look on <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/installation.html" target="_blank">ray documentation</a>

So if you go for a kube in local, make sure you have a kube cluster and helm install.

Then this command should work ``` make deploy_ray ```. Careful to the architecture which is arm64 (you have in comment those for x86_64 in the makefile).
